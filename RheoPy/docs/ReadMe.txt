This is a collection of tools I used while in grad school.
I'm also adding any kind of hobby projects in rheology to this collection. 

I haven't developed libraries with set ups in the past, so I'm using this as a learning opportunity. 

I'm also throwing in KNIME files to try to make this more accessible to in a low-code / no-code environment

The results of most of this is published here:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1466856423001546
but I'm starting simple and trying to build back the libraries a bit more fucntionally, so not all of it is there

Because of the virtual environmentin VS Code, I haave RheoPy as a library in that enviornmnet. This 
led to better running on my lcoal machine. I'll update it into something more transferable once I get
further down the develpment path
